Mathematical modelling: Forecasting cancer

Einstein once called pure mathematics “the poetry of logical ideas”. It is a poetry that has allowed astronomers to understand the movement of planets, and it has shaped our understanding of the physical world around us. Now it is set to reshape our view of cancer. From speeding up clinical trials to predicting cellular mutation and evolution, mathematical models are helping to transform fundamental ideas underlying the disease.

Mathematicians are making inroads in oncology with approaches that used to be the realm of biologists: building intricate models of cancer ecology and evolution. It's a logical transition. The forces of environmental selection and adaptation that act on organisms also govern the way cancer cells develop, and a better understanding of how the disease evolves and adapts to environmental changes can help researchers find a way to stop it. “Evolutionary theory is the theory for cancer,” says Carlo Maley, a computational and evolutionary biologist at the University of California, San Francisco. “If we can engage with this evolutionary process, we can slow it down or shunt it in a direction that's more manageable.”
