® We hold the optimistic belief that ever more detailed molecular analysis will lead to marvellous new cancer therapies. Yet there is clear clinical evidence that existing targeted therapies generally produce mere transient responses that are ultimately defeated by the relentless evolution of cellular adaptations. So we should stop to ask: will better treatments emerge if we apply ever more sophisticated molecular technologies to smaller and smaller populations?

This edition of Nature Outlook features efforts to connect cancer biology to the physical sciences. One important lesson physicists can teach us is the explicit separation of experimental observations and system principles. Whether analysing planetary motion, atomic spectra or subatomic particles, physicists do not define a system by empirical data. Rather, they use data to support or refute a postulated theoretical framework that defines the system's governing principles. In building a framework for cancer biology, I propose that — to paraphrase evolutionary biologist Theodosius Dobzhansky — cancer, like all biology, only makes sense in the light of evolution.

“Understanding the principles governing living communities does not necessarily require — and may even be obscured by — genetics”
In this spirit, I wonder whether genetic data are sufficient, or even necessary, to understand the evolutionary and ecological dynamics of cancer and its therapy. Darwin knew nothing of molecular genetics — his conceptual model of evolution required only an unspecified “mechanism of inheritance”. For nearly 100 years, evolutionary biologists and ecologists observed living systems at various scales and developed the fundamental principles governing complex biological communities with no working knowledge of the underlying genetics. This was possible because the dynamics of both individual organisms and their communities are governed by phenotypic, not genotypic, interactions with environmental selection forces. In other words, understanding the principles governing living communities does not necessarily require — and may even be obscured by — genetics.
