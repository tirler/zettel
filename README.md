We hold the optimistic belief that ever more detailed molecular analysis will lead to marvellous new cancer therapies. Yet there is clear clinical evidence that existing targeted therapies generally produce mere transient responses that are ultimately defeated by the relentless evolution of cellular adaptations. So we should stop to ask: will better treatments emerge if we apply ever more sophisticated molecular technologies to smaller and smaller populations?
